            <p>A Self-managedsuper fund (SMSF) is defined by the Superannuation industry supervision act of 1993 section17A and 1994 (SIS Act) administered by the ATO and (ch) 7 of the corporations Act 2001 administered by ASIC, superannuation is a way of saving for retirement, which will enable you to invest your contributions and the earnings (whether positive or negative) in your account into allowed investments as per this deed. When you retire, you can take your account balance as a lump sum or you can convert it into an income stream also known as an account based pension. In essence, an SMSF is a regulated superannuation fund with less than five members, who are primarily family members or close associates. The sole purpose of the fund is to provide income streams and/or lump sum benefits to members and their dependents and non-dependents, where allowed under the Superannuation Laws such as on the retirement, death or disability of the member.</p>
            <p class="subheading"> Superannuation</p>

            <p>The current 18 per cent tax offset of up to $540 will be available for any individual, whether married or de facto, contributing to a recipient spouse whose income is up to $37,000. This is an increase from the current $10,800.

There are no changes to the current aged based contribution rules. The spouse receiving the contribution must be under age 70 and meet a work test if aged 65 to 69. </p>

            <h4 class="subheading" style="margin-bottom:0; ">Excess Super Contribution Treatment</h4>
            <p>The consequences of exceeding your concessional cap generally involve extra income tax rather than onerous penalty tax, and exceeding your cap also involves some administrative inconvenience. Your excess concessional contributions will count towards your personal assessable income, and you will have to pay income tax at your marginal income tax rate from your personal savings on those excess concessional contributions since they are treated as part of your regular income. The ATO will apply a 15% tax offset when processing your tax return, to recognise the 15% contributions tax already deducted from the excess concessional contributions.</p>
            <p><span class="subheading">Note:</span> You will also incur an excess concessional contributions charge on the increase in income tax payable, to recognise the delay in paying income tax on this income.</p>
            <p><span class="subheading">Note:</span>from 1 July 2017, any salary sacrifice components or personal contributions made to a superannuation fund will be tax deductible</p>

            <h4 class="subheading" style="margin-bottom:0;">Types of Pensions</h4>
            <p>A pension is a way to receive your superannuation entitlement through a regular income stream instead of a one-off lump sum payment. There are two ways for you to open a pension account, these are either an Account-based pension or a Transition to retirement (TTR) pension.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="subheading">Account-Based Pension – </span>all members, who have retired and reached preservation age or have reached age 65, can convert a lump sum superannuation benefit into an Account-based pension where the following conditions are satisfied:
            </p>
            <ol class="listn">
                <li> i.	When you have reached your preservation age and are not intending to work 10 or more hours per week ever again; or</li>
                <li>
                    ii.	When you have retired or resigned from employment after turning age 60; or
                </li>
                <li>
                    iii.	When you have reached age 65 even if you are still working; or
                </li>
                <li>
                    iv.	When you are permanently incapacitated (at any age); or
                </li>
                <li> v.	At any age with unrestricted non-preserved benefits.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4 class="subheading" style="margin-bottom:0;">Transition to Retirement (TTR) pension</h4>
            <p>Allows members aged between preservation age and 65, access to their benefits in the form of an income stream; where a minimum pension amount is required to be taken, which is 4% of the asset value forming the pension and a maximum of 10% of the asset value; without having to retire or leave the workforce.</p>

            <p>(i)	Withdrawals</p>
            <p>There are limited circumstances in which you can withdraw your TTR Account-based pension to a lump sum.No part of a TTR Account-based pension can be withdrawn as a lump sum unless you meet a condition of release. However, you may be able to take a lump sum from a TTR Account-based pension to:</p>
            <ul class="listn">
                <li>comply with a Family Law Act 1975 splitting agreement;</li>
                <li>pay superannuation surcharge tax liability;</li>
                <li>withdraw any unrestricted non-preserved benefits; or</li>
                <li>pay excess contributions tax to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) if authorised by the ATO.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You may choose to reduce or stop your TTR Account-based pension at any time and transfer the money back into your superannuation account, provided you have met your minimum pension payment requirements for the year.</p>
            <h4 class="subheading" style="margin-bottom:0;">Conditions of Release of Super Monies</h4>
            <p>Preserved benefits (most super money is preserved) cannot be paid to a member unless a condition of release has been met. These conditions of release are:</p>
            <ul class="listn">
                <li><span class="subheading">Permanent retirement after attaining preservation age</span> </li>
                <li><span class="subheading">Termination of employment after age 60</span></li>
                <li><span class="subheading">	Attaining age 65</span></li>
                <li><span class="subheading">Commencing a Transition to Retirement Income stream </span>after attaining preservation age </li>
                <li><span class="subheading">	Death</span></li>
                <li><span class="subheading">	Permanent Incapacity –</span> To satisfy this condition of release the member must, as a result of ill health, be unlikely to ever engage in gainful employment for which the member is reasonably qualified by education, training or experience.</li>
                <li><span class="subheading">Severe financial hardship –</span> Satisfying this condition of release depends on a person’s age relative to their preservation age. If the member is younger than their preservation age the trustee must be satisfied that the member is unable to meet reasonable and immediate family living expenses and obtain proof that the member has received Commonwealth income support payments for a continuous period of 26 weeks. If the member has reached their preservation age, and wants to access all their super entitlements, the trustee must obtain proof that the member has received support payments for a period of 39 weeks after having reached preservation age and not in gainful employment when applying for superannuation payment. If they want to access a restricted amount then it is 26 weeks of support payments.</li>
            </ul>

    <span style="display:block;page-break-after:always"></span>
    <div class="page">
        <div style="padding:0 50px 50px;">
            <ul class="listn">
                <li><span class="subheading">Compassionate grounds – </span> to release on this condition the trustee must get approval from the Department of Human Services and show that the member has no other means of making payment. There are strict guidelines on what released benefits can be used on i.e. medical treatment, loan repayment to stop foreclosure on family home, palliative care etc.</li>
                <li><span class="subheading">Terminal illness – </span>this condition was introduced on the 1-July-2007 and to satisfy it two registered medical practitioners must provide proof that the member is likely to die in the next 24 months as a result of an injury/illness.  At least one of the medical practitioners needs to be a specialist in the area related to the injury/illness</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="subheading" style="margin-bottom:0;">Investment Strategy</h4>
            <p>The Trustee of the SMSF has broad investment powers under the proposed trust deed that the fund is using and is able to invest in private or public company shares; cash and fixed interest; commercial, rural and residential property; unit trusts and pooled superannuation trusts and is able to engage in property development and other pursuits provided the investment is in accordance with the Superannuation Laws. The Trustee of the fund may also borrow to acquire an asset provided the acquisition of the asset is permitted by the Superannuation Laws. The structure for any borrowing must be by way of a property trust to ensure the borrowing is compliant with section 67a and is a limited recourse borrowing arrangement (LRBA) and that it is a single asset that is acquired per property trust and per loan application made by the SMSF. </p>
            <p>The borrowing may be from a bank, building society, non-bank or a related party. The Commissioner of Taxation has issued extensive guidelines in relation to SMSF borrowing. The fund’s Trustee can create separate investment strategies for each member of the fund. Alternatively, a Trustee may establish separate investment strategies for differing member accounts including a member’s lump sum or pension account where applicable. However, this is not a mandatory requirement. In addition, the Trustee can use their power to create a pooled investment strategy for all members of the fund and all accounts provided the investment strategy meets the necessary requirements of the Superannuation Laws. </p>
            <h4 class="subheading" style="margin-bottom:0;">Responsibilities, Risks, Legal, Accounting, Advice</h4>
            <p style="margin-bottom:0;">All financial decisions carry risk, so it's important to think carefully about how you choose your investment options to balance the level of risk against the level of financial return and particularly with superannuation. At the end of the day, your superannuation is for your retirement and as retirement can last a very long time, great care must be taken when investing your super assets particularly in an SMSF. As one of the Trustees of the SMSF, it is your responsibility to ensure that your investments are tailored for the long term unless you are close to retirement or taking your benefits as a transition to retirement income stream as allowed under the superannuation laws.</p>
            <h4 class="subheading" style="margin-bottom:0;">Non-Compliance Risk</h4>
            <p>Where the Trustee of an SMSF makes an investment, it must meet all the compliance rules under the superannuation laws (the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act 1993). These are wide and varied and ensure that the Trustees of the SMSF do not invest in a related party – with some exceptions, do not lend money to a related party, are not to make investments and carry out investment and other transactions on a non-arm’s length basis and most important of all to ensure that a member of an SMSF does not benefit from the fund except as allowed under the superannuation laws. </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <span style="display:block;page-break-after:always"></span>
    <div class="page">
        <div style="padding:0 50px 50px;">
            <p> A breach of these laws can not only subject the Trustee to a significant financial penalty including taxing the market value of the assets of the fund at a flat rate of 45% but also land the Trustees of the SMSF in jail.</p>
            <h4 class="subheading" style="margin-bottom:0;">Trust Deed Risk</h4>
            <p>The Trustee of the Fund must acquire a modern trust deed for the fund – one that ensures it copes with changes to the laws and on-going strategies. It is the Trustee’s responsibility to read and understand the fund’s deed and make sure that it meets the requirements of all the members of the fund. In addition, as superannuation laws change and new strategies become apparent or used by Trustees of SMSFs, it is highly advisable for the fund’s trust deed to be regularly upgraded.</p>
            <h4 class="subheading" style="margin-bottom:0;">Borrowing Risk</h4>
            <p>The superannuation laws allow the Trustee of an SMSF to borrow money to acquire a single acquirable asset such as a residential or commercial property and in some cases a collection of shares that have the same characteristics such as market value, class of share, etc. and acquired at the same time. </p>
            <h4 class="subheading" style="margin-bottom:0;">Types of Borrowing Allowed</h4>
            <p>The deed allows conforming LRBA (limited Recourse Borrowing arrangements) and related party borrowing by the fund which conforms to the ATO’s PCG 2016/5</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom:0;text-decoration:underline">Terminating the Fund</p>
            <p>You have the power under the Trust Deed to terminate the Fund, although the Fund is intended to continue indefinitely. The SMSF fund may also be terminated in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed. In either case, we will notify members in advance. Benefits will be appropriately adjusted and transferred to an alternative complying superannuation fund or retirement savings account in accordance with the Trust Deed and applicable legislation.</p>
            <h4 class="subheading" style="margin-bottom:0;">Information about risks associated with the fund</h4>
            <p>The significant risks which a member must consider before joining this fund include the following:</p>
            <ol class="listroman">
                <li>the trustee may not invest the funds wisely, resulting in negative realised and unrealised gains;</li>
                <li>the fund may cease to be a complying superannuation fund either because of any action or inaction of the trustees. For example, the fund can become a noncomplying fund as the trustees may not be in resident of Australia and/or breaches the SIS Act or the SIS Regulations;</li>
                <li>future government policies may remove the current tax treatment of all SMSF. This may adversely affect the future planning of prospective member;</li>
                <li>by mistake the trustee may pay less than the minimum amount of pension, resulting in the fund to be a non-complying fund.</li>
                <li>as trustee of the fund, you are responsible for maintaining the accounts, books and minutes and if are not a meticulous person, you may not be able to devote sufficient time to properly administer the fund;</li>
                <li>since an SMSF is an audited entity, if you are not a pedantic person, who would keep all the documents safely for a successful audit, the auditor may issue a qualifying report;</li>
                <li>you may not keep your trust deed up to date or conduct activities (such as trading in futures) which are not allowed by your trust deed or SIS Act, this will result in your SMSF being non-complying fund and lose all tax concessions.</li>
                <li>you may not be entitled to a government pension due to asset test - 50% exemption for complying income streams.</li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            <p>As a trustee you will be involved in theday to day management of your SMSF, you should be in a better position to manage the above risks and protect your retirement benefits.</p>

            <h4 class="subheading" style="margin-bottom:0;">Costs of Operating an SMSF</h4>
            <p>There is a range of costs associated with establishing, operating and maintaining an SMSF. The level of costs incurred will also depend on the extent to which the Trustee has sought expertise in ensuring the fund remains complying and also has the best possible strategic set up for the Trusteeand members. The general cost involved with operating an SMSFare reflected in the table below.</p>
            <p>These costs should be compared carefully to the costs associated with being a member of an industry or retail superannuation fund. Saving on not getting the best possible advice or for that matter, acquiring the most strategic and up to date SMSF Trust Deed and Rules is a false saving as it limits far larger taxation savings as well as opening up the Trustee to potential fines, imprisonment and having the fund’s assets subject to tax as a non-Complying SMSF if there is a compliance breach by the Trustee of the fund. The extent of the costs will depend on the specific service provider and Trustees should discuss all costs with their SMSF professionals.</p>

            <h4 class="subheading" style="margin-bottom:0;">Why Setup a Self Managed Superannuation Fund</h4>
            <p>These are some of the benefits of setting up a S.M.S.F:</p>
            <ol class="listn">
                <li>Members get greater investment choice;</li>
                <li>Members get control of assets and fund monies unlike in a retail or industry fund;</li>
                <li>Participation in the fundsmanagement and decision making process;</li>
                <li>The formal reporting requirements are reduced compared with retail, industry and corporate funds;</li>
                <li>Members can customise their investment strategy to suit their needs</li>
                <li>Greater estate planning and benefit distribution flexibility</li>
                <li>Purchase a business premise for their business to operate in;</li>
                <li>control the timing of paying income tax onincomereceived by the fund;</li>
                <li>transfer In-specie contributions to the SMSF; and</li>
                <li>the ability to invest directly in property, both commercial and residential</li>
            </ol>
            <p>However, setting up an SMSF is not for everyone. Individuals considering setting up a self-managedsuperannuation fund should familiarize themselves with the requirements of running a fund. It is also prudent to discuss this option with a professional adviser (e.g. an accountant, financial planner etc.) before taking the next step.</p>
            <h4 class="subheading" style="margin-bottom:0;">Key responsibilities of trustees</h4>
            <p>Member(trustees) of an SMSF must abide by the following:</p>
            <ol class="listn">
                <li>all  provisions of the SIS Act 1993 & 1994;</li>
                <li>superannuation fund trust deedclauses;inclusive of</li>
                <li>other general rules, such as those imposed under tax law and trust law.</li>
                <li>
                    The SIS Act contains covenants or rules that impose certain requirements on
                    trustees and aredeemed to be included in the trust deed of every regulated fund. These covenants reflect the dutiesimposed on a trustee under trust law in general. They require trustees to:
                </li>
                <li>act honestly in all matters;</li>
                <li>
                    exercise the same degree of care, skill, and diligence as an ordinary prudent
                    person;
                </li>
                <li>act in the best interest of the fund members;</li>
                <li>
                    keep the assets of the fund separate from other assets (e.g. the trustee’s
                    personal assets);
                </li>
                <li>retain control over the fund;</li>
                <li>develop and implement an update the super fund'sinvestment strategy; and</li>
                <li>allow members access to certain information.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
    </div>
    <span style="display:block;page-break-after:always"></span>
    <div class="page">
        <div style="padding:50px 50px;">

            <p>Whilst trustees are not prevented from engaging or authorizing other persons to do certain actsor things on their behalf (e.g. engaging the services of an investment adviser), they are bound toretain control over the fund. Ultimate responsibility and accountability for running the fund in aprudent manner lie with the trustees.</p>
            <p>Trustees of SMSF’s must keep money and other assets of the superannuation fund separate fromtheir own personal assets. Similarly, the assets of the superannuation fund must also be kept separate from those belonging to a business (e.g. a business run by two partners who decide to set up an SMSF). Money belonging to the fund must not, under any circumstance, be used for personal or businesspurposes. This money is for retirement purposes and generally, cannot be accessed until retirement.The fund’s assets must not be viewed as a form of credit or emergency reserve when faced with a sudden need. The trustee decides the suitability of investments. In making investment decisions the trusteesmust act in accordance with the fund’s trust deed, investment strategy and the provisions of SISAct. Some of the more important issues to consider when investing an SMSF’s assets include theformulation of an appropriate investment strategy and investment restrictions.</p>
            <p> The trustee must establish investment strategies in writing, setting out how fund assets are tobe invested and may make a broad range of investments only in accordance with this strategy. Thestrategies may be altered by the trustee, so long as they remain appropriate. Members may choosebetween more than one strategy offered by the trustee, but may not choose how the trustee is toexecute the strategy.</p>
            <br />
            <p> SIS Act sets out various rules and restrictions on investments. These include:</p>
            <ol class="listn">
                <li>lending to members and their relatives</li>
                <li>acquiring assets from ‘related parties’ of the fund</li>
                <li>borrowing</li>
                <li>in-house assets; and</li>
                <li>making and maintaining investments on an ‘arm’s length’ basis.</li>
                <li>Trustees are also responsible for the fund’s ‘housekeeping’ including:</li>
                <li>
                    complying with record keeping requirements<br />
                    (such as minutes, books and financialrecords);
                </li>
                <li>preparing and lodging annual returns with the ATO; and</li>
                <li>getting the fund’s accounts audited annually.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If a trustee fails to act in accordance with the rules and obligations imposed on them, thetrustee may be sued by affected fund members and/or may jeopardize a fund's eligibility for tax concessions. In addition, the SIS Act imposes substantial penalties on trustees who have failed to carry out their duties.The above does not provide an exhaustive coverage of responsibilities of trustees. Many moreobligations are imposed on trustees under different laws including numerous administrative requirements.Trustees need to be familiar with them and when in doubt about these requirements, professionaladvice should be sought. </p>
