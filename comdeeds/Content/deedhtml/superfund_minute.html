                Investment Strategy
            </p>
            <p>Recent changes to Superannuation regulations (effective for years commencing 1 July 2017) broadly require SMSF trustees to:</p>
            <ul class="listn">
                <li>Consider insurance for members as part of the fund’s investment strategy;</li>
                <li>Regularly review their investment strategy;</li>
                <li>Keep money and assets of the fund separate from those held by a trustee; and</li>
                <li>Value assets at market value for reporting purposes – for FY2015/16 and future years</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>The legislation does not prescribe what time period constitutes “regularly” reviewing an Investment Strategy. General consensus is that anything less than an annual review would probably not be regarded as regular – accordingly we would expect this document to be reviewed, updated if necessary, signed and filed on an annual basis. </p>
            <p>As noted above, Trustees are required to consider “whether the trustees of the fund should hold a contract of insurance that provides insurance cover for one or more members of the fund”. This does not mean insurance is compulsory for members but it does mean Trustees need to be able to demonstrate their consideration of the requirement for insurance. Whilst the legislation does not specify how this is done most commentators recommend including a comment in either the Investment Strategy or the fund’s annual minutes. Whilst there is some debate in legal circles as to whether Trustees should explain their decisions regarding insurance (some legal commentators argue explaining why insurance was not put in place may create an avenue for future litigation), we expect most Trustees will provide some basis for their decision. Note: a fund may elect to have insurance for one member but not for others.</p>

            <p>The investment strategy outlined below represents an expansion and clarification of the Investment Strategy agreed at the formation of the 
                {trustname}</p>
            <p class="subheading">Objectives:</p>
            <p>The objective of the fund is to:</p>
            <ul class="listn">
                <li>Provide superannuation benefits to members and their dependants to meet their retirement needs.</li>
                <li>Ensure that appropriate mixes of investments are held by the fund to support these needs</li>
                <li>Ensure the fund has sufficient insurance and liquidity arrangements, to meet all commitments</li>
                <li>Maximise the tax effectiveness of fund investments thereby delivering the best long term after tax return for members.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Investment objective of the trustees is to aim to achieve real medium to longer-term growth. In recognition of the 25 year investment time frame of members the fund will have a high proportion of growth assets in the portfolio. </p>
            <p class="subheading">Investment Choice:</p>
            <p>The Trustees have determined the fund’s investments may include but not be limited to all or one of the following:</p>
            <ul class="listn">
                <li>Direct equities, stocks and derivatives including participation in dividend reinvestment programs and right issues, including the use of geared instalment warrants:</li>
                <li>Property trusts and associated investments:</li>
                <li>Managed investments and associated products: </li>
                <li>Direct residential, industrial and commercial property investment including geared property investments purchased using allowable limited recourse borrowing arrangements</li>
                <li>Deposits and investments with banks and other financial institution securities including Term Deposits, Debentures, Secured and Unsecured Notes and Bonds:</li>
                <li>Any other investment that the trustees may feel prudent to achieve the objective of the fund.</li>

            <p>The Trustee may from time to time decide to seek professional advice from Accountants, Solicitors or Financial Planners in the formulation or implementation of this or any future investment strategy. </p>
            <p>In formulating this strategy the trustees have taken into consideration relevant features of the various investments in accordance with both the fund’s objectives and appropriate legislation.</p>
            <p>In drafting this investment strategy, the trustees have taken into account all of the circumstances of the fund, including:</p>
            <ul class="listn">
                <li>the risks and likely return associated with each investment;</li>
                <li>the range and diversity of investments held by the fund;</li>
                <li>any risks coming from limited diversification;</li>
                <li>the liquidity of the fund’s investments;</li>
                <li>the ages and preferences of its members;</li>
                <li>expected cash flow requirements; and</li>
                <li>the ability of the fund to meet its existing and prospective liabilities such as paying benefits to its members.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="subheading">Policies:</p>
            <p><em> The policies adopted by the Trustees in order to achieve these objectives are: </em></p>
            <ul class="listn">
                <li>Regular monitoring of the performance of the fund’s investments, the overall investment mix and the expected cash flow requirements of the fund.</li>
                <li>Re-balancing the fund’s investment portfolio due to changes in market conditions through asset sales and new investments as appropriate.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Trustees will aim to follow the investment strategy, however, they will at all times reserve the right to change the investment mix depending on the market situation and opportunities available to better meet the objectives of the fund.</p>
            <p>A copy of the Investment Strategy of the fund will be available to members of the fund on request.</p>
            <p class="subheading">Risk profile and risk tolerance:</p>
            <p>The Fund has a medium/long time horizon. Further the members are prepared to endure a reasonable level of volatility of returns in expectation of long term growth. The members have existing equity and property investments outside superannuation and are familiar with the variability of both returns and capital values which are associated with such investments.</p>
            <p>Members understand </p>
            <ul class="listn">
                <li>the trade-off between investment risk and long term capital and income growth and have indicated [capital preservation & stability/asset growth] is a priority</li>
                <li>Investment risk is borne by the members, as fluctuations in investment returns will affect the level of benefits available to members.</li>

                Geared Investments:
            </p>
            <p>The Trustees have elected to purchase direct residential property using limited recourse borrowing arrangements. The Trustees have indicated they understand and are prepared to accept the increased volatility of returns associated with borrowing to invest, including the risk of loss, including the risk of total loss of invested assets where such assets are subject to limited recourse borrowing arrangements]   </p>

                Insurance:
            </p>
            <p>The Trustees have considered whether the Fund should hold a contract of insurance for its members and concluded that: </p>
            <ul class="listn">
                <li>The Trustees recognise the need for additional insurance and will take the following actions </li>

             and have no significant assets outside of superannuation. At the present time neither expect to access their superannuation prior to age 65. Cash in excess of anticipated liquidity requirement will be invested in accordance with the Fund’s investment strategy. </p>
            <p class="subheading">
                Asset Allocation:
            </p>
            <p>The targeted asset allocation will recognise the need to have a diversified asset mix, however, given the long-term investment horizon of the members of up to 87 years until life expectancy and the lack of significant assets outside of superannuation, the allocation will have a strong growth asset bias and be focused on maximising capital growth.</p>
            <p>The Trustees recognise the higher risk in investing predominantly in growth assets and the volatility associated with shares and property.  The volatility will be compensated by the prospect of achieving higher returns and growth in the longer term.  In order to minimise this risk, the member / Trustees will consider investing in different industries and sectors where possible.</p>
